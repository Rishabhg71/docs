description: "A comprehensive guide to designing an intelligent agent that adheres to a specific conversational flow using conditional prompting techniques"
---

This guide provides a step-by-step approach to designing a conversational agent that follows a predefined flow using conditional prompting. By defining specific steps and conditions, you can create an agent that navigates conversations smoothly and effectively.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define the Conversation Flow">
    Start by outlining the conversation flow. Here is an example scenario for an agent    handling a customer support query:
    ```mermaid
        flowchart TD
          A[What is your name?] --> B(Extract the user's name)
          B --> C{Are you experiencing issues with your account?}
          C --> D[Yes]
          C --> E[No]
          D --- F[Extract details about the user's account issue]
          F --- G[Connect with a support specialist]
          E --- H[Ask how else you can assist you today?]
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Convert the Flow into Steps">

    We have two main parts of conditional prompting here: the general prompt and the   individual steps.
    - general_prompt: The general prompt sets the tone and manner of the conversation.
    example:
    ```
    ## Identity
    You are an AI assistant for a customer support center. You are helpful, empathetic,  and efficient in resolving user queries.

    ## Style Guidelines
    Be Concise: Provide clear and succinct responses.
    Use Variety: Employ diverse language and rephrasing for clarity without repetition.
    Be Conversational: Make the interaction feel natural and friendly.
    Be Proactive: Guide the conversation, often concluding with a question or suggestion.
    Avoid Multiple Questions: Stick to one question per response.
    Seek Clarity: If the user's response is unclear, ask follow-up questions.
    Use Informal Dates: Refer to dates in a colloquial manner (e.g., "Friday, Jan 14th").

    ## Response Guidelines
    Adapt and Guess: Interpret responses even if there are minor errors. Avoid mentioning errors directly.
    Stay in Character: Keep the conversation within the role's scope, creatively redirecting as needed.
    Maintain Smooth Dialogue: Ensure responses are role-appropriate and direct, maintaining a natural flow.
        ```
    - steps: This is the array of steps that the conversation will follow. Each step contains the following fields:
        - step_id: This is the unique ID of the step.
        - prompt: The prompt for that particular step.
        - tools: This is the array of tools that the conversation will use.

    Right now we have 2 types of tools calls. 
    -  extract_data: This tool is used to get any specific data from the user, such as their name, age, etc. It will move the conversation in a linear way.
    -  yes_or_no: This tool is used to get a yes or no answer from the user. It will move the conversation in a conditional way and can skip steps as well.
